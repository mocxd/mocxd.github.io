# My (ultra opinionated) thoughts on agile

1. story points are shit
2. agile tools are shit
3. user stories should be literally on sticky pads if even used at all
4. better yet, instead of user stories just write wtf you want to do and put it as a generic ’item’ in the backlog
5. just build good shit, agile is not an effective crutch for shit dev
6. 'real artists ship’  — steve jobs rip
