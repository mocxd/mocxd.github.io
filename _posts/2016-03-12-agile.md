# My (ultra opinionated) thoughts on agile

1. story points are shit
2. agile tools are shit
3. user stories should literally be sticky notes if used at all
4. better yet, just write wtf you want to do and put it in the backlog
5. just build good software, agile is not an effective crutch for bad dev
6. 'real artists ship’  — steve jobs rip
